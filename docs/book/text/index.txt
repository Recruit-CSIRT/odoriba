Cuckoo Sandbox Book
*******************

Cuckoo Sandbox is an *Open Source* software for automating analysis of
suspicious files. To do so it makes use of custom components that
monitor the behavior of the malicious processes while running in an
isolated environment.

This guide will explain how to set up Cuckoo, use it and customize it.
