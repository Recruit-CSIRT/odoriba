## Requirements
* [Cuckoo sandbox requirements](http://docs.cuckoosandbox.org/en/latest/introduction/sandboxing/) is necessary.  
In Addition, python modules  
* requests, selenium webdriver, BeautifulSoup, InsecureRequestWarning  

## Usage
change network signitures in several python codes : your **IP**, **user-agent** etc, modify **"Write your own"** values.    
In your UNIX Host machine (ex. OSX),   
`$ cd ~`  
`$ git clone https://github.com/Recruit-CSIRT/odoriba.git`  

set your Guest Machine configuration in ./conf/
set your Guest IP in ./internet_control.py (this modules support VirtualBox and VMware)

<python 2.7.x>   
`$ python odoriba.py [vmware or virtualbox] [add or init or none] [malwr or ax or none]`  
// sys.argv[1] = GUEST VM environment , odoriba support vmware or virtualbox  
// sys.argv[2] = Setting options  
*init = cuckoo have't launched yet.*    
*add = cuckoo launched and add malware seeds via sys.argv[3]*    
*none = cuckoo launched and skip add seeds*    
//sys.argv[3] = Where malware download from   
*malwr = malwr's recent analysis samples* **Malwr implemented Google reCAPTCHA, this option doesn't work now.**   
*ax = your FireEye AX*     
*none = skip download and you can submit manually*      

if you batch collect malware seeds, set cron this procedure.  
 `$ python odoriba.py [vmware or virtualbox] add [malwr or ax]`  

After Cuckoo Sandbox start working, you can submit files and urls to cuckoo's submit page.
